    Taking international interns is harder for companies as they have to deal
    with the visa process and it costs more to fly you over and house you.

Don't just restrict yourself to the companies here though. Applying to multiple
companies greatly increases your odds of getting an offer (since tech companies
are notorious for the false negatives in their recruitment process).

## Immigration Gotchas
Be aware of various immigration restrictions such as the two-year home-country
residency requirement for certain countries[^2] and the timeline for [H-1B
visa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa) application which affects students
that need H-1B visas and graduating in Semester 2.

Companies with offices outside of the U.S. usually are not too concerned about
these issues, as they can post you to a global location first until they can
bring you to America.
