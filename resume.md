# The Resume
This is one of the biggest barriers faced by students. We literally have nothing
relevant to put to get the recruiter's attention. The good news is, that
everyone if in the same boat, or at least the people trying to secure their
first internship. The key point to note here is that _tech resumes differ from
normal resumes._

The following resources best explain how to get your resume right:

  Laakman McDowell who worked as a software engineer at Microsoft, Apple and
  Google and was on Google's hiring committee. Great insights.
