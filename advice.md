# How to prime yourself for an Internship?
It can be pretty daunting. For some of you, you've just started
computing/programming. You are probably thinking about how you can keep up with
everyone else. Well, the good news is that [you are not running out of
time](http://rahulbijlani.com/essays/you-are-not-running-out-of-time-essay/).
Its not too late to start now, and you certainly can become good enough to get
to where you want to be.

For a start, read this document:
[Notes to Computer Science Freshmen, From The Future.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FbCWcnnajHWk594dKmN35b_we50WZf_-cwxqg-cYaRY/edit)

Welcome back. If you didn't read the document and just stepped over the link
above, you really should. The document contains information that students, like
yourself, wished they knew when they were in your shoes. The document provides a
nice basis for this section. It covers advice on how to do well in SoC, or
Computer Science in general. Most of which is highly relevant if you want to do
an internship at a tech company. After all, if you are doing well, you chances
of getting that internship you dream about get that much higher.

## Learn stuff, well and fast
The key point here is to optimize for learning and learn the basics well. Where
possible, take harder classes and challenge yourself. Its also really important
to not let your learning rate be dictated by class. There are hundreds of people
in school just like yourself, what's going to set you apart from them?

## Do side projects
We can't stress the importance of this enough. Unless you've somehow manage to
prove that you can program (Winning Informatics Olympiad for instance), this is
your best bet in showing the companies you can.

Being in college, your resume is probably empty or filled with irrelevant
experience like National Service, being a Student Leader in some organization,
Community service etc. Not to downplay these achievements, (which you should
definitely put on your resume as they speak of your other qualities) but
companies aren't exactly going to hire you to be a software engineer based
solely on these qualities.

No. They are looking for evidence that:

- You can code
- You are passionate about what you are doing
- You are able to learn stuff on you own

Side projects are the best way to do all three. Plus, they have the added bonus
having great learning value. Think of something, build it. Better yet, learn
git, version control your code, and share it on github. See
[nusmods.com](https://github.com/ahbeng/NUSMods) for a great example of a side
project. You'll probably use it soon or already have.

## Keep improving
As mentioned in the previous sections, internship applications are really
competitive. This makes it even more important that you are able to
differentiate yourself from your peers.

Summer and winter breaks are an excellent time to do just that. If you don't get
an internship this summer, make the summer count towards making next year's
application that much better. Companies re-interview candidates all the time
(obviously with a reasonable period of time between interviews) so don't worry
that you didn't make it this time around and focus on doing better the next.

Code widely. The more hours you clock coding under you, the more proficient
you'll become. You don't need to be implementing complex algorithms or machine
learning systems all the time. Even small web projects with some logic code
help. The hours you put into the practice will train and strengthen your
proficiency in implementing an intended logic in an elegant and concise manner.
This helps a lot.

That said, be daring to explore. If you're feeling comfortable all the time when
coding, something is wrong. When you learn a new algorithm or data structure, go
implement it in your language of choice. Play with it. Optimize it. Understand
it well. Internalize it.

Reading existing code also helps. There are many open source projects and there
is no lack of good quality code you can learn from. Many programmers upload
their code for certain data structure or algorithms freely on their website or
blogs. Implement some yourself, and then look at how other (hopefully smarter
and more experienced) people implemented theirs. There are a lot of things you
can learn from this; from new programming language constructs or syntactic
sugars you never knew existed, to very basic patterns and styles that make up
good code.

## Preparation/Career planning
__You _don't_ start preparing for technical interviews when you know you have
one coming up.__

Some things like data structures and algorithms knowledge, problem solving
skills and coding proficiency take time to build up. You'll probably need more
than a few months to get significantly better at this, so start early, and do it
consistently. Practice makes perfect. The best part is that the skills are
useful beyond just the technical interviews.

Going through the recruitment process is inevitable. Don't wait till its too
late, when you're in your final year, when a lot is riding on the outcome of a
particular interview to start.

In addition, ask seniors for help. They probably can give you more tailored
advice and help you more than you imagine.

## Don't accept _no_ for an answer
Getting an intership is hard but its really important that you keep at it (if
you want to get one of course). You can only get better at interviewing and your
experience through the process (even rejection) will help you find out the areas
which you need to improve upon. Its never too early to start, even as a
freshman (yes, we have precedence).

## NUS SoC Specific Advice

### Mandatory Modules to take seriously
The following CS modules are mandatory for all students. Yet, it is easy to
neglect them and/or not give them as much attention as they deserve. Many
students mistakenly think that, for instance, discrete math is a waste of time
and completely irrelevant to programming and so they take it less seriously.

#### CS1231 - Discrete Structures
Every incoming freshman has to take this module. It __is__ super important.
Don't take it lightly or give up when you find the module hard.

#### CS2103 - Software Engineering
For most people, this module's project will be the first major software project
they've done. Its a great opportunity to gain some experience regarding
application design, working with a larger than usual codebase, as well as level
up in terms of your coding competency.

### Optional Modules to take

#### CS1101S - Programming Methodology
In your first semester, you get a choice between CS1010 and CS1101S. Take the
latter. No seriously. While CS1101S is obviously going to be more intensive,
both in terms of time and effort, the rigor in the module helps you grow.

In addition, CS1101S is definitely more comparable to the introductory
programming modules of top colleges than CS1010, and given the competition for
internships, it should be pretty obvious why you would want to take the more
rigorous module here.

Most freshmen fall into the trap of thinking that because they are new to
Computer science, they should take the lighter module to learn progressively.
Many of the seniors who took CS1101S had no background. They didn't do badly.
There are, of course, exceptions. If you think you won't be able to cope with
the heavier course load, ask a senior or better yet, the professor.

__Some people take CS1010 for a _free A_.__ Frankly nothing is free. Think about
what you are paying for this supposedly _free_ A.

#### CS2020 - Data Structures and Algorithms Accelerated
In your second semester, you get the choice between two tracks for Data
Structures and Algorithms. The first is "accelerated", comprise one 6MC module.
The other comprises two 4MC modules that will span two semesters.

__If you can do it, (you need an A- and above for your introductory programming
module), you should do CS2020.__ It cannot be stressed enough how important Data
Structures and Algorithms is in getting an internship offer. (See the technical
interview section.) Learning these concepts earlier means more time for you to
think about them and get good at apply them.

Again, CS2020 is more aligned with the equivalent courses in the top CS
colleges.

#### CS3230 - Algorithms
Take this class seriously. It is unfortunate due to the large class size that
past iterations of this course have not been conducted in the most conducive
manner. However do not underestimate the importance of acquiring strong and
formal knowledge of algorithm, proofs, and basic complexity theory.

### Other things

#### Teach. Be a teaching assistant if you can
If you get the chance, become a TA. It is no secret that you learn when you
teach. Most people are turned away because teaching is a highly time consuming
endeavor. It's true, so do plan your time wisely.

### Grades. _Exactly how important is your GPA?_
It is hard to measure. Most of the recruiters are familiar with a US GPA system
which is out of 4.0 but NUS's GPA is out of 5.0. That said, this is most likely
not the most important factor.

Your grades should be good. After all, it's one of the signals recruiters use to
tell _if you know your stuff, albeit a pretty flawed one._ That being said, your
absolute CAP is way less important to the companies than the other skills
mentioned.

Your CAP is probably only going to be useful in the early stages of the
recruitment process. Even then, there are other ways, better ways, to make your
resume stand out.
