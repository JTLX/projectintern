# Why a summer internship?
You're an undergraduate, and you just survived yet another semester of NUS.
You're probably awaiting your results, and worrying about your CAP, and planning
some holiday trip (take your pick: Thailand/Vietnam/Bali) with friends.

## What's an internship again?
A summer internship is a 3 month stint at a company. During which you'll
essentially be working as you would a real job. Typically, you get assigned a
team, a manager and you ship production code.


## Why bother doing an internship?

There are a couple of reasons.

### $[^1]

An internship with a large company in the valley pays USD$7000-USD$8000 (Google,
Facebook, Microsoft, Palantir), with free lodging, food, bikes, laptops, etc
depending on the company and ridiculousness of the recruiting department. An
internship with a valley startup pays USD$3000 - USD$8000, depending on the
stage of the startup, and your role.

So reason #1: you'll earn a lot. Way more than if you spend your parent's money
in Bali. (Well, you'll still be spending money - cough, Amazon Prime cough
- but at least it's yours).

Money is not a good enough reason, though. There are other more important
reasons. We cover some of the more obvious ones here:

### Learn a _lot_
If you want to be good at what you do, you better optimize for learning.
Interning in the valley, with some of the brightest people in computing, will
teach you way more about the industry and computer science than studying books
alone ever will.

Practically speaking, what this feels like is that you'll now return to school
with context for all the things your Professors are teaching you. You'll find
more things interesting and useful. You'll see why Machine Learning is hot, even
if the equations your professor throws on the board are anything but. You might
even begin reading papers, hoping to collect as many good ideas for technical
projects in the future.

As you learn you become more attractive to future employers. Its win-win.

### Discover what you like
During your internship, you'll get to try out what you actually do after
graduation. A tech internship is essentially a trial for what working full-time
at the company is like. You spend three months discovering what works for you.

The best part is, if you like it, you'll already have a foot in the door at the
company, or any other company for that matter. Imagine what having Google,
Microsoft, Facebook or any other tech company on your resume will do for you.

### Its really fun
Doing an overseas internship is pretty much like an extended vacation: you'll
have a ton of fun.

There are plenty of places to go in the US, and too many things to do. Be it
shopping discounted designer goods at Gilroy, wine tasting at Napa, fruit
picking at Portola Valley, visiting the MoMA, skydiving, hacking at the
hackathon of the week (there is one every week, trust us), or hiking at Yosemite
- you'll be spoilt for choice.

Additionally, you get to meet the who's who in tech and get to know other
interns from other colleges.
