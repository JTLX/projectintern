# The Recruitment Process
The recruitment process process differs from company to company, though they
overlap somewhat.

Here is an overview of the typical recruitment process:

0. Apply
1. First Contact
2. Phone Screens & Technical Interviews
3. Offer

## Apply
This is the first step you need to take. Whether it's sending your resume,
getting a referral, or contacting a recruiter. Many people don't even get to
doing this. They think that they don't stand a chance and so they don't even
bother trying.

__If you don't make contact, you are never going to get recruited.__

Application channels:

0. Job's site, eg. <google.com/jobs>
1. Career fair
2. Info sessions/Tech talks
3. Referrals (from friends, previous interns etc)

__Internship applications start in the fall (Sept) and stretch till Jan. You
should start ASAP. Don't wait till its too late.__

As you would imagine, summer internships are highly sought after. You'll be
competing with students from all over the world. Applications start as early as
the fall (once the summer ends) and spots get taken over time. The latest you
can probably expect to get an offer is one month before the summer. Though that
is the exception. The later it gets, the less openings there'll be, both within
the company and within the teams. Naturally, the more attractive companies and
teams are the first to go.

### First Contact
There is usually a long and painful wait between the first step and this one.
Most people don't even hear from the recruiters. Just imagine the number of
resumes the recruiters receive and the number which they are physically capable
of responding to. __So don't lose heart if you don't hear from the them. See how
you can make your application better the next time round and try again next
summer.__

When a recruiter gets back to you, he/she will then brief you on the upcoming
rounds and also will be your point of contact for the process. This includes
scheduling interviews and collecting various information from you.

### Phone screens & technical interviews
The difference between a phone screen and technical interview is fairly
arbitrary. You can think of the phone screen as a watered down technical
interview. It is less demanding and usually way less technical. Phones screens
are meant to weed out the people who look good on paper but really should not
proceed any further.

Technical interviews, on the other hand, are usually more involved and involve
coding and problem solving. You generally get at least 2 technical interviews
(possibly more). Each interview usually lasts for about an hour and are
conducted over skype/phone and an online collaborative document where you are
expected to code.

Most people fail here due to __a lack of preparation__.

Some of the questions asked might include:

- Recall questions
- CS fundamentals
    - algorithms
    - operating systems
    - networks
- Technical discussions
- Coding
- Problem solving
- Runtime analysis

#### Onsites (rare for interns)
Some companies prefer to have these instead of over-the-phone interviews. Some
only do this for full time recruitment. Some companies fly their engineers down
to interview a group of people instead of flying everyone there. It's different
everywhere.

Onsites don't differ too much from over-the-phone interviews besides you having
the advantage of body language.

Also, don't worry if a company proposes this. They'll cover all related costs
(flight, hotel, transport, meals etc).

### Offer
Great, you made it. Its time to decide if you want to take the offer from the
company. You might want to think about the following things before you put your
signature on the piece of paper. This applies even more so when you have more
than one offer on the table.

- __Product__: What product will you be working on? Are you excited about it?
- __Compensation__: Don't forget to factor in taxes, housing, food, cost of
  living and other factors besides the absolute paycheck. These things add up.
- __Location__: This really boils down to personal preferences. Assuming its an
  internship in the U.S, you might want to try a different city if you've
  already been in one the previous summer.
