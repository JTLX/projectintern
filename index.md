# Project Intern
Project Intern is about getting more SoC students summer internships with tech
companies. We hope to consolidate all the information regarding getting an
overseas summer internship. With a focus on:

- NUS SoC students
- Internships with tech companies in the U.S.

We don't mean to say that there are no interesting internships outside the US -
in the past, SoC students have, in fact, interned at companies in Sweden,
Canada, Japan and the UK. But the truth is that the biggest and most interesting
tech companies are based in the US.

Every summer, talent pours into the Valley, with interns taking up apartments
and hotels and train stations, filling up hackathons and picnic fields and event
halls. (These things happen at other technology centers in the US, of course.
But SV is where it's at).

This means you'll get to meet some incredibly talented people. It means that
you're probably going to have a lot of fun doing it. And it also means - given
that you'll be spending 3 months in such an environment - that you'll learn a
_lot_.
